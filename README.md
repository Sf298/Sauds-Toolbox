# Saud's Toolbox

This is a toolbox of Java Classes I have written.

It includes:
* ApplicationProperties - Allows for easy file management.
* BigArray - An array structure that supports memory paging.
* DeepFileIterator - A simple iterator for recursive file searches.
* Encryption - A set of encryption utilities. Includes an algorithm to encrypt and decrypt strings (may not be secure, do not use with important data).
* GetterFrame - A quick and less painful way to create Swing dialogs to for user input.
* PrimitiveArrayWrapper - Similar to Arrays.asList(), but supports primitive arrays.
* Timer - A Java stopwatch with split and lap features.
* Fractions - A Class that works like a float but remains as a fraction.
* Graphs - Allows for the creation of graphs with pre-implemented iteration tools. 
* Multiprocessing Tools - A simple yet powerful toolset for multithreaded looping over arrays, maps and collections.
* propsFile - Portable tool to quickly create and manage properties files (can be encrypted).
* Server-Client Manager - A handy tool for supporting server-client connections.
