# Saud's Toolbox

This is a toolbox of Java Classes I have written.

It includes:
* GetterFrame - A quick and less painful way to create Swing frames to for user input.
* Timer - A Java stopwatch with split and lap features.
* fractions - A Class that works like a float but remains as a fraction.
* propsFile - Portable tool to quickly create and manage properties files (can be encrypted).
* Encryption - A quick dirty algorithm to encrypt and decrypt strings (may not be secure, do not use with important data)
